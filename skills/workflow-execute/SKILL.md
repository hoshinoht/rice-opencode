# Goal

Execute an approved workplan through scoped implementation, validation, and
review while keeping workplan state current.

# Preconditions

- PLANNING has been completed or the user explicitly accepts executing with a partial plan.
- A workplan id or clear plan file is available, unless the task is trivial enough to skip durable planning.
- The requested execution scope is clear enough to avoid guessing.
- If the plan is well specified, continue autonomously until completion; do not stop unless validation, safety, scope, dependency, or a user-decision issue blocks progress.
- If the plan hits a material snag or would require scope creep, ask the user instead of deciding unilaterally.
- Be religious about updating the workplan, as the harness may undergo context compaction and lose critical detail.

# Execution methodology
0. If the plan has not already been vetted by `plan-checker`, do so immediately.
0a. Ensure the plan passes codebase reality checks with `plan-checker`; apply recommended changes autonomously unless they introduce material scope creep, architecture changes, dependency changes, or user-facing tradeoffs.
1. Read or adopt the workplan.
2. Validate the workplan before changing implementation files (if not already done so).
3. Read the linked Markdown plan and any linked `specFiles`.
4. Identify the next executable phase/step and its file ownership boundaries.
5. Decide whether work can be done directly or should be delegated to `@code-writer` (parallel as planned or as necessary).
6. If there are critical cross-dependencies overlooked by the plan, you may run `code-writer` in serial (one by one) instead.
7. Run the narrowest useful validation after small changes. For large/potentially consequential changes, run `@code-checker` adversarial review. Use code-checker for slice-wide audits. If changes are small, wait until the end of a larger slice before code-checker.
8. Record progress, validation, and review findings in the workplan.
9. Loop only on concrete review findings; stop when validation passes and no blocker/critical/major findings remain.

# Workplan tool subset for execution

## Readiness and context

- `workplan_read`: use at the start of execution to load full JSON metadata and linked Markdown plan detail.
- `workplan_inspect`: use before targeted phase/step status updates, review-finding updates, or handoffs that need exact ids.
- `workplan_validate`: use before implementation, after major workplan changes, and before declaring completion.

## Execution state updates

- `workplan_update`: use for machine-readable progress:
  - mark phases/steps `in_progress`, `review`, `completed`, or `blocked`
  - add relevant files discovered during execution
  - append validation notes
  - add review findings from `@code-checker`
  - mark findings resolved after a fix pass
- Omit unchanged optional fields. Never pass blank strings for `planFile`, `planMarkdown`, or other optional values.
- If a frontend/tool schema displays blank optional placeholders anyway, treat them as omitted. Do not retry the same failing `workplan_update` call in a loop; use `workplan_patch` for Markdown-only changes, `workplan_reset` for explicit draft resets, or stop and report that the loaded workplan tool is stale.
- Do not use full `planMarkdown` for routine progress updates.

## Markdown execution notes

- `workplan_patch`: use only for small localized updates to linked Markdown plan prose, such as completion notes, clarified acceptance criteria, or refined handoff detail.
- Keep `patchText` minimal.
- Do not use `workplan_patch` as a substitute for JSON status, findings, relevant files, or phase/step state.

## Recovery and stale plans

- `workplan_list`: use if the provided plan id is missing or ambiguous.
- `workplan_reset`: use only when the user wants to restart a stale plan or regenerate Markdown from JSON metadata before execution.
- `workplan_create`: normally not used in execution. If no workplan exists for non-trivial work, pause and create/validate one only if the user accepts that planning is incomplete.

# Delegation contract

Every non-trivial handoff to `@code-writer` should include all of the following unless a field is genuinely unknown:

- `workspaceRoot`: absolute workspace root path
- `cwd`: absolute working directory for the task when different from the workspace root
- `workplanId`: persistent workplan id when one exists
- `workplanPath`: absolute path to the JSON metadata when it helps avoid workspace-root mistakes
- `planFile`: absolute path to the Markdown execution plan when one exists
- `phaseId` and `stepId`: exact workplan phase/step to execute when applicable
- `specFiles`: architecture/specification files the child must follow for this pass
- `laneId`, `ownedFiles`, `blockedFiles`, `laneDependencies`, and `mergeOrder`: when parallel child lanes are used
- `goal`: one sentence describing the user-visible outcome for this pass
- `scope`: the exact files, routes, components, or systems allowed to change
- `nonGoals`: what must stay unchanged in this pass
- `constraints`: user constraints, dependency approvals, route stability requirements, or runtime constraints
- `inputs`: exact facts already established from the user, workplan, and local evidence
- `validation`: precise commands or smoke checks to run for this pass
- `deliverable`: what the child must return to the parent

Preferred handoff shape:

```text
Implementation contract
- workspaceRoot: /abs/path
- cwd: /abs/path
- workplanId: example-workplan
- workplanPath: /abs/path/.opencode/workplan/example-workplan.json
- planFile: /abs/path/.opencode/workplan/example-workplan.md
- phaseId: phase-x
- stepId: step-x-y
- specFiles: docs/specs/README.md, docs/specs/features/x.md
- laneId: lane-a
- ownedFiles: A and B only
- blockedFiles: C is owned by lane-b
- laneDependencies: wait for phase-y only if noted
- mergeOrder: lane-a then lane-b
- goal: Implement X without breaking Y.
- scope: Edit only A, B, and C.
- nonGoals: Do not change D or E.
- constraints: Keep route structure stable; approved deps are X and Y only.
- inputs: Existing workplan already exists; local AGENTS.md applies; current routes are ...
- validation: run cmd-1; smoke check route-1 and route-2
- deliverable: summary, files changed, validation results, blocker if any
```

Do not send a child agent off with only the user prompt when the task depends on workspace-specific state or an existing workplan.

# Parallelization policy

- Run a parallelization assessment by default after workplan validation.
- Parallelize only when tracks are independent, scopes are disjoint, and merge order is obvious.
- Good parallel examples: discovery in one lane while another lane reviews docs; route A and route B when they touch separate files; implementation in one lane and test planning in another.
- Bad parallel examples: two writers editing the same file set, two lanes deriving the same architecture, or any split that would require the child agents to guess ownership boundaries.
- Define candidate lanes, owned files, blocked/shared files, dependencies, merge order, and validation targets before launching parallel child work.
- If using parallel child work, define each lane's file ownership and validation target explicitly.
- After parallel lanes complete, reconcile their outputs in the parent, update the workplan once, then run the relevant validation and review loop.

# Decision rules

- Work directly only for very small changes where orchestration would be slower than execution.
- Prefer one active workplan per non-trivial task.
- If the user provides a workplan id, read that exact workplan from the current workspace root before doing anything else.
- Always treat the current project directory as the default `workspaceRoot`; if a workplan read fails, verify the root and list existing workplans before assuming none exists.
- Before delegation, read applicable local `AGENTS.md` and include relevant local commands or conventions in the handoff when they materially affect execution.
- Use a single `@code-writer` lane when dependency, file ownership, validation, or merge-order risk makes parallelism ambiguous; otherwise split into clear lanes.
- After each implementation or review pass, update the workplan with status, relevant files, open findings, and next steps.
- Mark review findings as open or resolved in the workplan instead of tracking them only in transient messages. When recording `@code-checker` severities, map `Critical -> critical`, `High -> major`, `Medium -> minor`, and `Low -> note` unless context warrants `blocker` or `question`.
- Keep fix loops narrow and evidence-based.
- If test scope is unclear or risky, narrow the validation contract before handing work off instead of guessing broad coverage.
- Stop the loop when validation passes and `@code-checker` has no unresolved blocker, critical, or major findings.

# Stop rules

- Do not run more than 3 implementation/review cycles without either converging or surfacing a blocker.
- Do not continue the same agent more than once (total 2 invocations) for smaller fixes you may continue up to 3 times.
- If the same issue repeats without progress, stop and explain the blocker.
- After changing global tools, agents, skills, or config, remind the user to restart opencode so the changes load.
